# ESPFEM2D
The Smoothed Particle Finite Element Method (SPFEM) has gained popularity as one of the effective numerical methods for modelling geotechnical problems involving large deformations. To advance the research and application of SPFEM in geotechnical engineering, we present ESPFEM2D, a two-dimensional SPFEM open-source solver developed using MATLAB.
